# The Annoyance/Problem

So, every year lakhs of students have to make a critical choice of choosing the college, they want to attend, as we here have fixed ranking, if you get a certain percentile above the cutoffs, you will get to attend that batch, but here is where a massive problem lies, we personally and lakhs of other students are stuck with sub par data, found on various random sites, and blogs all over the internet, the problem you may ask? This data is highly misleading, outdated, and outright wrong at times, and it doesn't even fulfill it's purpose, the irony is, all of this data for college cutoffs, their stats, from spending, to batch sizes are published every year, you may ask, why don't students use this? It's cause the data is massive, these are pdfs mostly and span across thousands of pages of unsorted, inaccessible data, that follows no standard, so here comes the solution we handcrafted at this FossHack.

Our believe in solving this problem became even more clear, when we saw not 100s, but 1000s of posts on the student run, subreddit of mhtcet, where students posted their percentile and preference, hoping for help, but sadly for them, there wasn't any way out there, they had to manually figure it out, and hope they were right with their choice, until now!

# The Solution

"deetnuts.com" a webapp that, solves this problem, we went through the tedious process of scraping these pdfs, converting them into usable csv's, and making the data accessible, as per the needs of students across the country, we knew just publishing the csv's out there, won't solve the problem, so we went ahead and build an accessibility & usability first table, which allows the students the ultimate control on the parameters, they would like to toggle, and find the exact colleges, they are eligible for, this would save the students (who presumable are under a lot of pressure already), greatly ease out their work of finding a good college

We have read enough stories, where people were unaware of better college they could get into, but didn't know it, cause there never had been a go to, one stop solution for it, instead of going through 10s, if not 100s of different website, keeping notes, they can find it with a few toggles, and deetnuts make this happen!
