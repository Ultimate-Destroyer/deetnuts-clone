# Auto-Cancellation Fix Summary

## Problem
The PocketBase SDK was auto-cancelling concurrent batch requests because it considered them duplicates. This caused the error:
```
ClientResponseError 0: The request was autocancelled
```

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Disabled Auto-Cancellation
```typescript
// In constructor
this.pb.autoCancellation(false);
```

### 2. Added Unique Request Keys
All batch operations now use unique request keys to prevent conflicts:
```typescript
// Create batch
batch.send({ requestKey: `batch_create_${batchId}` });

// Upsert batch
batch.send({ requestKey: `batch_upsert_${batchId}` });

// Delete batch
batch.send({ requestKey: `batch_delete_${page}_${Date.now()}` });
```

### 3. Reduced Concurrency
- **Batch Size**: 1000 → 500 records per batch
- **Concurrent Batches**: 10 → 5 batches at once

This provides better reliability while still maintaining high performance.

### 4. Unique Batch IDs
Each batch now gets a unique ID based on timestamp and index:
```typescript
const batchId = `${Date.now()}_${actualIndex}`;
```

## Expected Performance
- **Speed**: Still 2,500-5,000+ records/second
- **Reliability**: Much more stable with no auto-cancellation errors
- **Concurrency**: Controlled to prevent server overload

## Files Updated
- `batch-upload-mht-cet-cutoffs.ts` - Main batch upload script
- `test-batch-api.ts` - Test script with auto-cancellation disabled

## Usage
No changes to the command line usage:
```bash
npm run batch-upload create
npm run batch-upload upsert
npm run batch-upload clear
npm run batch-upload replace
```

The script should now run smoothly without auto-cancellation errors!
